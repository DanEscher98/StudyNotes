# Smart Contract Tools

## IDEs
- **[Remix](https://remix-project.org/)**: An integrated development
  environment (IDE) that provides a range of features for Solidity developers.
  It includes a compiler, debugger, and testing environment, as well as a
  built-in code editor
- **[Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint)**: Solhint is a linter for
  Solidity code that checks for common errors and style issues. It can be
  integrated into your development environment to provide real-time feedback on
  your code.

## Testing and Debugging:
- **[Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/)**: A development environment,
  testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum that provides built-in
  smart contract compilation,
  linking, deployment and binary management.
- **[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/)**: Part of the Truffle
  Suite, Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that you can
  use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests.
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs)**: A development environment to
  compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. Hardhat includes a
  network for testing and makes debugging easier. 
- **[Infura](https://docs.infura.io/infura/)**: A scalable infrastructure
  provider that allows you to connect to the Ethereum network without running a
  local node. It provides a range of features, including access to the Ethereum
  API and a range of developer tools.

## Static Analysis and Security:
- **[MythX](https://mythx-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html)**: A
  security analysis API for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides a
  comprehensive range of security vulnerabilities and does so in an accessible
  and flexible manner.
- **[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)**: A Solidity static analysis
  framework that can find bugs and improve code quality. It detects
  vulnerabilities, developer mistakes, and improves the quality of your code.
- **Securify**: A security scanner for Ethereum smart contracts that provides a
  formal verification of the contract's code.
- **[Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore)**: Manticore is a
  symbolic execution tool for analysis of binaries and smart contracts.
- **[Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna)**: A Haskell program designed
  for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smart contracts. It uses
  sophisticated grammar-based fuzzing campaigns based on a contract ABI to
  falsify user-defined predicates or Solidity assertions.
- **[K Framework](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics)**: A
  system for specifying languages and systems, and a platform for creating
  language-based tools. It can be used to formally verify Solidity contracts.

## Reverse Engineering:
- **[Etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/)**: A Block Explorer and Analytics
  Platform for Ethereum. It provides a disassembler for analyzing EVM (Ethereum
  Virtual Machine) bytecode to make it easier to understand what the smart
  contract is doing.
- **[ethersplay](https://github.com/crytic/ethersplay)**: Binary Ninja plugin
  which enables an EVM disassembler and related analysis tools.
- **[evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone)**: An Ethereum Virtual Machine
  implementation. It can be used to execute EVM code and thus reverse-engineer
  smart contracts.

## Libraries
- **[OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)**: A library
  of reusable smart contract components that can help you save time and ensure
  your smart contracts are secure. It includes a range of pre-built contracts,
  such as ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, as well as tools for testing and deployment.
- **[BoringSolidity](https://github.com/boringcrypto/BoringSolidity)**: A set
  of libraries for Solidity smart contract development that aims to simplify
  and standardize common tasks, reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, and improve
  overall code quality. It was developed by ConsenSys Diligence, a leading
  security audit firm in the blockchain industry.
