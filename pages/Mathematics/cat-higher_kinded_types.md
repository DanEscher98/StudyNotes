# Higher-Kinded Types (HKT)

A higher kinded type is a concept that reifies a type constructor as an 
actual type.

A type constructor can be thought of in these analogies:

- like a function in the type universe
- as a type with a "hole" in it
- as a container containing type(s)
- as a generic type, parameterised over other types
- as an endofunctor in the category of types

To be able to use them in places where concrete "proper" types are usually 
expected, a language must support the concept of higher kinded types.

There are 3 keywords in "higher kinded types":

- **Higher**: The "higher" prefix is derived from the phrase "higher order". In terms of programming, it usually refers to a function that can at least take other functions as input, or return functions as output. However I think in this case, the prefix has become more general, and refers to a form of recursive containment. Basically it's the idea that a type could contain
  other types. See concepts like "higher order messages". This makes sense, and
  seems to define they very concept of type constructors and/or recursive data
  structures. Here we use the word "contain" to mean parameterisation of things
  related to itself, and/or returning of things related to itself. Refer to 1st
  order and 2nd order logic literature for more:

- **Kinded**: Kinds are the types of types. Most "proper" types have a kind
  signature of `*`. But higher order types, or type constructors could have a
  kind signature of `* -> *`. The ability of having higher kinds defines a type
  constructor.

- **Types**: Finally of course I believe this term signifies a reification of
  our type constructors as a first class type that can be manipulated using the
  same tools that we manipulate normal `*` "proper" types.

## Haskell

Haskell has good support for higher kinded types. Every type constructor such as 
they `[]` can be used as a "first class type".

This is specifically relevant to typeclasses such as the `Functor` typeclass.

```hs
> :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -> *) where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
  (GHC.Base.<$) :: a -> f b -> f a
        -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘Data.Maybe’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((->) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
```

Each of those instances are implementations of the Functor class for a 
particular higher kinded type. For example, we see `[]`, which we know is a type 
constructor but it is also a higher kinded type, since we can use it like a 
"first class type".

## Rust

Rust 1.0 currently lacks support for higher kinded types. This doesn't mean it 
doesn't have container types or type constructors. It certainly does. It just 
hasn't reified them into a higher kinded type that can be used like a first 
class citizen. It is however on the roadmap.

Just a note about syntax:

- `trait <-> class`
- `impl <-> instance`
- `enum/struct <-> data`

However there are interesting resources for working around this:
