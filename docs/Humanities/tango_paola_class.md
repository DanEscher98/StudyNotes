# Tango practice with Paola


## Friday 21/June/2024

- Excercises:
    - Dance with a pen: A tango song is played and the student must "dance" by
      tracing on paper. The objective is to observe the musical elements to
      which the student pays the most attention.
    - Hold the embrace structure: During three tango songs, the student must
      form the structure of the hug (close ribs, vascularize the hip, relaxed
      knees, open back, stretched spine) while holding the two ends of a rope,
      keeping it taut. The purpose of the rope is to show if the activation of
      the hug is lost.
    - Listen by sight: Given a tango video (preferably a competition one with
      multiple couples dancing), put the audio on mute and try to discern what
      genre is being danced (tango, milonga, valz). Extra points if you can
      argue which orchestra it could be.
- Notes:
    - Steps need to be longer.
    - Walk with a normal cadence; without over-tensioning.
    - Do not generate noise when sliding the foot.
