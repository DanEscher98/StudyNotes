# Understanding memory

## Kinds of memory and its applications:

> Each byte in the memory is addressable

- `Global/static`:
    - Static memory persists throughout the entire life of the program
    - Is usually used to store things like global variables
    - Or variables created with the static clause
- `Stack`:
    - the stack is managed by the CPU
    - It's a LIFO structure. Every time a function declares a new
        variable, it's "pushed" onto the stack
    - variables are allocated and freed automatically
    - the stack it not limitless – most have an upper bound
    - the stack grows and shrinks as variables are created and
        destroyed
    - stack variables only exist whilst the function that created
        them exists
- `Heap`:
    - the heap is managed by the programmer, and is the portion of
        memory where dynamically allocated memory resides
    - in `C`, variables are allocated and freed using functions like
        `malloc()` and `free()`
    - the heap is large, and is usually limited by the physical memory
        available
    - the heap requires pointers to access it
    - If all references to allocated memory are lost (e.g. you don't
        store a pointer to it anymore), you have what is called a
        memory leak.
    - Unlike the stack where memory is allocated and released in a
        very defined order, individual data elements allocated on the
        heap are typically released in ways which is asynchronous
        from one another.
